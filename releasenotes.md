# What's New in Version 1.10
This document outlines the new changes to the transmission pack since the previous version was released.

## GDC Transmissions
### Shift Logic
- Added an entirely new section in the parts configuration page to change the shift logic mode
  - Modes
    - Balanced: Balances Performance with Fuel Efficiency. Best for everyday use.
    - Maximum Performance (Track Mode): Does what the title says. To hell with fuel efficiency and let that engine sing.
    - Maximum Fuel Efficiency: Some call it turtle mode, others call it grandma's driving. Limits downshifting and decreases throttle response to improve fuel efficiency.

## Hypershift Transmissions
- Removed extraneous torque converters. Now there's only one and it's selected by default. 

## CVT Transmissions
- Gabe's CVT Transmission is now named "Gabe's 7000RPM CVT Transmission", to better match the naming scheme of the other CVTs and to specify which engines it can be used with.
