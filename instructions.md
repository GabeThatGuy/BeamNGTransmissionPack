# Installation Instructions
In this file, you'll find detailed instructions on how to install and use the transmisisons in this pack.

## Extracting the Contents
1) After downloading the latest release from GitHub, which can be found on the right hand side of the repo's homepage, open the ZIP file and locate the folder called "vehicles".

2) Open a new window of the file explorer (`Ctrl + N`), and click on the path bar at the top of the window.  
3) Type: `%appdata%/../Local/BeamNG.drive/latest.lnk` and press `Enter`. 
4) Open the folder called `vehicles` and then switch back to the ZIP folder you downloaded. 
5) Once there, open the folder also called `vehicles` and select the contents. 
6) Then, drag those contents into the other window you have open (should be BeamNG's vehicles folder). 
7) Once that's done, you're all good to close both windows and open up the game.

## Using the Transmissions
To use the transmissions, first spawn into any map with any vehicle that can be found in the `README.md` file under the Supported Vehicles section. Open the parts selector and navigate to the `Engine` section and open the dropdown for which transmission to use. You should now see the transmissions from this pack in that list.

> Note! Automatic and Hypershift Transmissions require Torque Converters. It is recommended to use the `HO 10-Speed Torque Converter` for the best experience.
